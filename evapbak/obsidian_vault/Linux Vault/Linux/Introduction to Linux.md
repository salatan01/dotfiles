Linux or correctly name Gnu/Linux is an FOSS projected developed by Linus Torvalds as a hobby project . But the Unix like nature and free of cost made it the favourite choice of the server and computer market. Linux is everywhere  including the 90% of the severs , Data Center , Super computers etc. Even you're android phone is based on Linux. But the Linux desktop market is still relatively small only about 4-5% of the market . But my love for Linux made me step into this world . I was introduced to Linux mint a beginner friendly distribution in early 2025 but i was using it not more than 15 days in 6months . I used ubuntu like total 20-30 days and Fedora Linux for 1-2months . Finally in the January 01 i fully shifted to Nixos ([[Introduction to NixOS]]) as my primary distribution.

From this day I vow to [[Master Linux]] and make to the very few who ever lived on this planet.....

My Dear Lord please help me so I can follow my passion and continue climbing to the top...........
